# Azarath-Nelle-Chatbot
Azarath/Nelle is a very basic Python chatbot that uses the Chatterbot library and right now only does simple greetings. However, in the future, it might have a few more functions. The main use for this was so I can tinker w/ making a chatbot for the first time. Thank you for seeing this and I hope you use it! Cite me if you use it.
